# Personal Passion Project
## Make your own T-shirt design!
With this project, the user will have the possibility to upload 3-5 different images into the app. The application will delete the background of the inserted images and will create a new image with those 5 inserted images. The images can go from just a person to some object to an air-fryer, etc.
## What can the app do?
- Collect images of user
- Recognize people and objects
- Seperate Foreground (person or object) from Background (This will be deleted)
- Collect all seperated Foregrounds and paste into 1 picture
- Show final image on a t-shirt
