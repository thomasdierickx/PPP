# Personal Passion Project
## Make your own T-shirt design!
With this project, the user will have the possibility to upload 3-5 different images into the app. The application will delete the background of the inserted images and will create a new image with those 5 inserted images. The images can go from just a person to some object to an air-fryer, etc.

## What does the app utilise?
### SwiftUI - Core ML

## What can the app do?
- Collect images of user
- Recognize people and objects
- Seperate Foreground (person or object) from Background (This will be deleted)
- Collect all seperated Foregrounds and paste into 1 picture
- Show final image on a t-shirt
- Take inserted text of the user and past it on the image

## What should the t-shirts look like?

These are just examples of what the end result should look like. Of course working with Machine Learning is not always the most optimal solution and the end result might still be buggy but thats where the machine learns and upgrades itself! The end rsults in this project will be more or less simplyfied.
